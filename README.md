# Kaspel

## Why Kaspel?
Programming nowadays come with a multitude of tools which aid the programmer in the coding process.
Code completion tools provide the user with a list of suggestions based on what they write, and Language Servers catch errors before the program is run.
But what about good old fashioned grammar? What is aiding the user with picking good variable names which make gramatical sense?

Enter **Kaspel**!

Kaspel is a new programming language which provide gramatical aid in both Nynorsk and Bokm√•l!
Using the two provided extensions **.nn** and **.bm** the interpreter knows which grammar it should use, and if you mispell, an error will be thrown!

Kaspel comes in two versions:
*   Online
    *   The online version of Kaspel uses an online dictionary to check the grammar, so the programmer does not have to have the dictionary on their computer!
*   Offline
    *   The offline version of Kaspel lets the programmer have the dictionary locally installed on their computer so they can program without the need of a network connection!


    ## Its amazing!
